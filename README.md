#### üìä Features
Through this application, the coaching staff and other interested parties can conduct comprehensive analysis of the selections and matches in the FIFA World Cups. Some of the main features offered by the application include:

- Statistical Analysis: Users can explore individual statistics of each team, comparing different selections in terms of total goals, ball recovery, carry, clearance, dribbles, duels, fouls committed, fouls won, interceptions, passes, and shots. These pieces of information are presented clearly and concisely through radar charts, allowing for pattern identification and trend analysis.

- Playing Style Analysis: The application enables a deeper analysis of the playing style implemented by the teams in each match. Users can visually examine the distinct characteristics of each selection, analyze the adopted tactical strategies, and identify strengths and weaknesses of each team. This analysis can assist the coaching staff in making informed decisions regarding pre-game preparation, defensive and offensive strategies, performance evaluation, and tactical adjustments.

- Interactivity and Accessibility: The application was developed with a focus on interactivity and accessibility. Users can intuitively explore the data, filtering the information according to their needs and preferences. The application interface is user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a pleasant user experience.
